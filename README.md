# UW Off-Campus Reading
Are you ever been outside UW, without your VPN, and decide to read the latest paper
only to find out that you need to use the off-campus version of ACM or IEEE but
can't remember the URL?

This extension updates the PDF access button to direct straight through the
off-campus link for that paper! No VPN needed!

Currenlty supported websites:
- ACM
- IEEE
